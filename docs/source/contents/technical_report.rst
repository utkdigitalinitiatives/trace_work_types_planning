Technical Report Work Type
==========================

About
-----

This work type represents technical report objects in our institutional repository.

Content of this work type should meet the
`Google Scholar inclusion guidelines <https://scholar.google.com/intl/en/scholar/inclusion.html>`_ and be discoverable
in Google Scholar.

These objects should always have:

1. The uploaded work
2. Descriptive metadata
3. Proper metatags for correct Google Scholar Inclusion

Migration Scope
---------------

Items migrated like this will come from select collections.

The primary file type should be a :code:`pdf`.

Suggested Actions
-----------------

1. Only objects whose primary file type :code:`PDF` should be migrated as this work type.
2. We need to generate a cover page for these that match our descriptive metadata.
3. We will only keep supplemental files that are mentioned

Example
-------

For this example, let's use the contents of :code:`https://trace.tennessee.edu/ce_reports/2`:

.. code-block:: text
    0-JonesWierschem_CEE_Report.pdf
    JonesWierschem_CEE_Report.pdf
    metadata.xml
    stamped.pdf

This object includes a descriptive metadata file, the original file uploaded, and a copy of the file with
a cover page.
