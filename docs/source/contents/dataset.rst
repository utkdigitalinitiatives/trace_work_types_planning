Dataset Work Type
=================

About
-----

This work type represents datasets from our institutional repository.  Datasets have :code:`1-n` files and each may
be open or restricted from public access.

Datasets are different from other works and deserve there own worktype in order to be included in
`Google's Dataset Search <https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/>`_.

Should datasets be in there own tenant?
---------------------------------------

Arguably, yes.  The primary purpose of treating datasets as its own worktype is to enable dataset sharing in Google
Dataset Search.  Google Dataset Search has a different inclusion methodolgy than Google Scholar that more resembles standard
indexing practices. In addition to requirements for :code:`JSON-LD` or :code:`rdfa`, this requires a sitemap with proper
canonical tagging, and the sitemap should describe only the datasets. Therefore, having a separate tenant makes things easier.

That being said, it is important to remember that we have very few datasets, and we don't have clear direction or policies
for our approach to taking datasets in the future.

A potential workaround for including datasets in our planned tenant then is to simply create a small feature that queries
our instance for dataset works and generate a separate sitemap around those. The works described in the sitemap should
all have proper :code:`JSON-LD` or :code:`rdfa`.

Migration Scope
---------------

Datasets in Digital Commons are currently metadata only objects that reference `Trace Deposit <https://trace.utk.edu>`_.

Datasets are in two series (collections):

.. code-block:: text

    utk_datasets
    utk_geogpubs

Currently, these are our list of datasets:

.. code-block:: text

    utk_datasets/14/metadata.xml
    utk_datasets/15/metadata.xml
    utk_datasets/16/metadata.xml
    utk_datasets/17/metadata.xml
    utk_datasets/18/metadata.xml
    utk_datasets/19/metadata.xml
    utk_datasets/20/metadata.xml
    utk_datasets/21/metadata.xml
    utk_datasets/23/metadata.xml
    utk_datasets/24/metadata.xml
    utk_datasets/25/metadata.xml
    utk_datasets/26/metadata.xml
    utk_datasets/27/metadata.xml
    utk_datasets/28/metadata.xml
    utk_datasets/29/metadata.xml
    utk_datasets/30/metadata.xml
    utk_geogpubs/30/metadata.xml

Using a bit of sparql, we can determine what our list of datasets in Digital Commons should be:

.. code-block:: sparql

    PREFIX rels-ext: <info:fedora/fedora-system:def/relations-external#>
    PREFIX model: <info:fedora/fedora-system:def/model#>
    SELECT $pid FROM <#ri> WHERE {{
    ?pid rels-ext:isMemberOfCollection <info:fedora/utk.ir:fg>;
    model:hasModel <info:fedora/islandora:compoundCModel> ;
    model:label ?label . }}

That returns these results:

.. code-block:: json

Suggested Actions
-----------------

1. If an object in Digital Commons refers to a object on trace.utk.edu that is not an ETD, we will migrate the object into the new repository as a dataset. It cannot stay at trace.utk.edu for security reasons.
2. If an object is in Trace Deposit and not an ETD, we will migrate it to the new system as a dataset.
3. We will provide the vendor for migration pages with front matter but without the coverpage.
4. The vendor will build a feature to add the appropriate cover page.
5. The vendor will build a feature for front matter going forward.

Example Dataset
---------------

For this example, let's use :code:`https://trace.tennessee.edu/utk_datasets/1`.

In Digital Commons, no files are currently managed, but in Trace Deposit there are several files and an original metadata.
Datasets in Trace Deposit are compound objects with the metadata record attached to the compound object and 1 to many binary
objects that belong the the compound object. In this instance:

* Compound object: https://trace.utk.edu/islandora/object/utk.ir.fg%3A18
* Binary object: https://trace.utk.edu/islandora/object/utk.ir.fg%3A15
* Binary object: https://trace.utk.edu/islandora/object/utk.ir.fg%3A16
* Binary object: https://trace.utk.edu/islandora/object/utk.ir.fg%3A17

For migration, we want to move the metadata from the compound object and each binary object.

Suggested PCDM Model for Fedora
-------------------------------

Google Dataset Inclusion
------------------------

Datasets should not go to Google Scholar, but should go to Google Dataset Search.

Unlike Google Scholar, Google Dataset Search relies on a structured body via a Schema.org mapping in a :code:`script`
tag in the :code:`head` of the document.

Our metadata mapping will include this conversion for this worktype.

name
----

A descriptive name of the dataset. For example, "Snow depth in the Northern Hemisphere".

The name property is modeled as `Text <https://schema.org/Text>`_.

-----------
description
-----------

A short summary describing the dataset.

The summary must be between 50 and 5000 characters long and may include Markdown syntax. Embedded images need to use
absolute path URLs.

The description property is modeled as `Text <https://schema.org/Text>`_.

-----------------------

Alternative names that have been used to refer to this dataset, such as aliases or abbreviations.

The property is modeled as `Text <https://schema.org/Text>`_.

-------
creator
-------

The creator or author of this dataset.

If the creator is a person, it should be modelled as a `Person <https://schema.org/Person>`_. If it is an
organization, it should be modelled as a `Organization <https://schema.org/Organization>`_.

To uniquely identify individuals, use ORCID ID as the value of the sameAs property of the Person type.

To uniquely identify institutions and organizations, use ROR ID (`UT Example <https://ror.org/020f3ap87>`_).

--------
citation
--------

Identifies academic articles that are recommended by the data provider be cited in addition to the dataset itself.

properties. For example, this property can uniquely identify a related academic publication such as a data descriptor,
data paper, or an article for which this dataset is supplementary material for.

Don't use this property to provide citation information for the dataset itself. It is intended to identify related
academic articles, not the dataset itself. To provide information necessary to cite the dataset itself use name,
identifier, creator, and publisher properties instead.
