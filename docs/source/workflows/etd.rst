Defining the Current ETD Permissions
------------------------------------

Digital Commons provided us a `spreadsheet <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Co3YdRxkshUrqgIu2dKsnYvL_43HV6FX/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=104017723280373055358&rtpof=true&sd=true>`_
of all unique current permissions in our repository. The spreadsheet describes:

1. The email of the individual who can perform a permission
2. The permission they can perform
3. The series / collection where they can perform it

Our ETDs are split into two series:

1. http://trace.tennessee.edu/utk_graddiss
2. http://trace.tennessee.edu/utk_gradthes

Currently, these emails have permissions in utk_graddis or utk_gradthes:

* smagalla@vols.utk.edu
* sobrien6@vols.utk.edu
* thesis@utk.edu
* ltrott1@utk.edu
* cmccurr4@vols.utk.edu
* vaucoin@vols.utk.edu
* andhcogg@vols.utk.edu
* tkiattik@vols.utk.edu
* kconley3@vols.utk.edu
* asherm10@utk.edu
* jmorg105@utk.edu
* mbagget1@utk.edu
* spica@utk.edu

People listed above have some of these permissions in utk_graddiss and utk_gradthes:

* Is an editor
    * This permission is not explicitly defined by Digital Commons. Is this related to journals? @todo: review journal series for its permissions.
* Batch upload
    * Upload articles in bulk using either Excel or XML
* Receive email notifications
    * Get automatically generated emails and those triggered by administrator/editor actions for the publication.
* Batch revise
    * Generate and download an excel file of a publication’s metadata and make changes in bulk.
* View Configuration tab
    * Access the Configuration page and its subsequent tools.
* Update
    * Update the site to make changes visible on the front end.
* Submit for Authors
    * Access the submission form and upload content on behalf of authors.
* See Reviewers link
    * Access the list of reviewers for a publication and assign reviewers to articles.
* Edit submissions in this publication
    * Access the Manage Submissions screen and its subsequent tools.
* View Digital Commons Dashboard
    * Access the `Digital Commons Dashboard <https://bepress.com/reference_guide_dc/digital-commons-dashboard/>`_ and receive monthly administrator reports.
    * The Digital Commons Dashboard provides a central location for repository administrators and editors to access current download activity, alternative metrics, and usage reports on demand. Whether viewing data for a repository or for specific publications, dashboard tools offer a number of ways to assess and share usage information via four main tabs:
        * Readership: Get a comprehensive picture of where and how users are accessing content geographically, by institution, and over time. The Readership tab is active by default when you first load the dashboard.
        * Usage Reports: Run reports showing downloads, metadata page hits, works posted, or individual works for the content and time frame selected.
        * PlumX: See the full impact of your institution’s content with a variety of article-level insights and alternative metrics.
        * Share the Dashboard: View saved dashboards and share them with stakeholders to demonstrate impact with no login required, and track the number of views.
* Send mailings
    * Send email notifications to a list of subscribers.
* Register Decision
    * Record editorial decisions and send decision emails to authors whether or not content is being peer reviewed.
* Can see all submissions
    * View submissions assigned to all administrators or editors in a publication. Without the permission, administrators/editors only see submissions that have been assigned to them.
* Create volumes, issues, tracks, and themes
    * View links in journals to create new volumes and issues, and links in event communities to create new themes and tracks.
* Create administrators
    * Add other administrators and modify their permissions.
* Edit submissions in this publication
    * Access the Manage Submissions screen and its subsequent tools.
* Select full text download format
    * Choose the most appropriate format for an article, particularly when the article was converted from a native file into a PDF. This permission also allows an administrator to change a submission to metadata-only, saving the file on the back end while removing access to it on the front end.
* Is assigned submissions by default
    * This is a “chief editor” permission whereby new submissions are automatically assigned to the administrator who has this permission. Only a single administrator should be given this permission per publication structure.
* Lock submissions when assigned to this user
    * Submissions assigned to an administrator with this permission will be “Locked,” preventing authors from making any changes until the administrator chooses to unlock the submission.
* Can harvest content from 3rd parties
    * Access and use the `DC Harvesting Tool <https://bepress.com/reference_guide_dc/digital-commons-harvesting-tool/>`_
    * This tool integrates with Scopus, Pure, ORCID, PubMed, and Sherpa-Romeo automates many time-consuming faculty publication workflow steps to populate your IR more comprehensively including:
        * Find all your institution’s works
        * Identify OA content
        * Map and prepopulate high-quality metadata for upload, plus import full-texts from Pure
        * Check for duplicate records already in your IR
        * Check permissions for multiple journals at a time
        * Populating a brand new, or recently migrated IR
        * Standing up faculty publication workflows for the first time
        * Seeking even more efficiency with existing faculty publication workflows
        * Looking to improve departments’ and faculty members’ engagement with the IR
        * Seeking improved ways to support the research enterprise on campus
        * Wanting to identify more open access content to host
        * Wishing to extend content visibility from Pure while avoiding duplication
