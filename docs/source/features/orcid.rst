Orcid Integration User Story
============================

-----
About
-----

This page describes the University of Tennessee's expectations for integration between Orcid and our institutional
repository service, TRACE.

This page also serves as a guide for us thinking about the intersection of ORCID, name authorities, Google Scholar
inclusion, and the values that are stored as part of descriptive metadata in SOLR, Fedora, etc.

Reviewing Other Implementations

The University of Virginia
==========================

The University of Virginia maintains a `UVA-ORCID Connector <https://www.library.virginia.edu/services/orcid-at-uva/>`_
that allows researchers to create or connect an ORCiD iD, verify their UVA affiliation, and display and use the iD in
the University of Virginia’s systems.  This system insures:

* an iD can be connected to an institution only via direct permission.
* a user can remove the institution connection to your iD at any time.
* the user can change visibility, share, or remove information, such as scholarship works in their ORCID record at any time.
* a user can add more identifying information to their ORCID record at any time.

Once a researcher connects their ORCID iD to UVA, the Library’s Libra scholarly repository shows their ORCID iD on each
LibraETD or LibraOpen work for which you are an author or co-author and adds citations of the work to the ORCID profile.
